# SPReact
Framework allows React app to be deploy on the SharePoint without using SPFX


SPFX is the most lovely way to create SharePoint App.
However technically speaking React app with any UI framework is static client side app. That means we should able to host the app inside SharePoint folder and should be able to render it.

This project creates possibility to develop that React app and deploy on SharePoint App catelog.

The SPFX developers would be able to create a SPREACT app with same skillset like NODEJS, NPM, Typescript etc.

PART 1: First we would like to create a npm module for creating SPREACT app using the below command
  npx -install create-spreact-app



Requirements: Node version : 18 lts or above
